# Go - Templ - Tailwind example project
This project serves as a brief example of how Go, Templ, and Tailwind can be used to create an interactive webpage 
without the need for any JavaScript. \
Sqlite is used as the database, as it's not the goal to showcase how SQL can be done.


## Structure

* `main.go`: All requests & db initialization
* `/internal/persistence`: Access to objects.
* `/internal/views`: Templ fil
* es to render the HTML
* `/static/css`: Css configuration files. `style.css` is generated by Tailwind.

## Developing
Execute the following commands: 

* `air`: Restarts the app if any Go files change
* `templ generate --watch`: Compile *templ files to Go source
* `npx tailwindcss -i ./static/css/input.css -o ./static/css/style.css --watch`: Re-compile any css files if any template files change.


## Requirements
* [Air](https://github.com/air-verse/air)
* [Templ](https://templ.guide/)
* [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
